# Stego Ctf's WIP
I like those challenges and had a good idea for some project.  
Found this awesome stego-tookit repo https://github.com/DominicBreuker/stego-toolkit  
Its contains a lot of tools that can be used for the solving of stego challenges.

## Next Features!

    -   Add file upload / delete
    -   Handle file scans in temporary folders on backend side
    -   Add more tools
