# Stego Ctf's
I like those challenges and had a good idea for some project.  
Found this awesome stego-tookit repo https://github.com/DominicBreuker/stego-toolkit  
Its contains a lot of tools that can be used for the solving of stego challenges.

## Tasks  
### 1  
Add flask server to the stego image.  
Develop some kind of api that can be used to start the different tools; file, binwalk etc.  
File upload? Maybe.  

### 2  
Make a "simple" Frontend that can communicate with the backend and display it in the browser.
