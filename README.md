# Stego Ctf's WIP
I like those challenges and had a good idea for some project.  
Found this awesome stego-tookit repo https://github.com/DominicBreuker/stego-toolkit  
Its contains a lot of tools that can be used for the solving of stego challenges.

My goal is to provide a webapp that can be used to start the stego tools and evaluate the results.
